            <h3>Determining Your Size</h3>
            <p>The starting point for businesses to understand the Affordable Care Act is figuring out their size. The new law includes two sets of rules: one for large businesses and another for small businesses. This guide includes advice for businesses that fall into the large employer category. An additional guide for small businesses will be issued separately.</p>
            <h3>Are you a large employer?</h3>
            <p>Here’s a quick way to tell if you fall into the large employer category. If you do, you can follow the links in the following chart to get more information about the requirements, penalties, taxes, fees and notifications that apply to large employers.</p>

            <h3 class='how-to-determine-your-size'>How To Determine Your Size</h3>
            <p>First things first. If you have 50 or more full-time employees, you fit into the large business category and are subject to the provisions, penalties, taxes and fee, and notifications for large employers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Full-time Employee:</strong>
            Under the ACA, a full-time employee is one that worked on average at least 30 hours a week. Another way of defining full-time employee under the ACA is an employee that averages 130 hours of service in a calendar month.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Full-time Equivalent Employee (FTE):</strong>
            To figure out how many full-time equivalent employees a company has, add the hours worked by all part-time employees and divide that number by 120. For example: a company has 36 part-time workers that work an average of 100 hours a week, which translates to an additional 30 FTWs for that company. (36 part-time workers x 100 hours &divide; 120 = 30 FTEs). If your company has special circumstances, you should consult your tax advisor.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='page sect-0 pg-j grandfathered-plans'>
            <h3>Grandfathered Plans</h3>
            <p>When the ACA was passed, the government promised Americans they could keep their current healthcare plan if they choose to do so. Thus the ACA “grandfathered” plans that were in effect on March 23, 2010 (the day the law went into effect) allow them to keep the plans and benefits they already had.</p>
            
            <p>Grandfathered plans do not have to comply with all of the provisions of the ACA, but they must provide certain benefits to their members if they were not already in place.</p>
            
            <p>The patients’ rights that must be included in any grandfathered plan include:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>(REQ) No lifetime limits on coverage and no annual dollar amount restrictions</li>
            <li>No recission of coverage if people accidentally made a mistake on an applications</li>
            <li>Extension of parents’ coverage to include young adults under the age of 26</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>However, those existing plans cannot make certain changes including:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Eliminating or reducing benefits</li>
            <li>Increasing cost-sharing</li>
            <li>Reducing the employer contribution toward the premium</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If a plan makes one of those changes, it will no longer have grandfathered status, and it must also comply with other provisions of the ACA.</p>

            <h3 class='how-health-insurance-coverage-is-changing'>How Health Insurance Coverage is Changing</h3>
            <p>The Affordable Care Act established what it calls a shared responsibility for federal and state governments, insurers, employers, and individuals to improve the availability, quality and affordability of health insurance coverage. Beginning in 2014, each individual in the United States has a shared responsibility as well to get basic health insurance, or minimum essential coverage.</p>
            <strong class='blue minimum-essential-coverage'>Each individual is now responsible for getting basic healthcare coverage (minimum essential coverage).</strong>
            <p>The ACA requires each individual in the United States to obtain minimal essential coverage as part of the individual’s shared responsibility for healthcare. An individual may obtain that coverage from a variety of sources. In some cases, an individual can apply for an exemption or make a shared responsibility payment to the IRS when filing federal taxes.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Basic health coverage required for each individual:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>It is the responsibility of employees and all Americans to obtain some sort of health coverage.They can get the type of coverage that best meets their needs, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coverage under a federal program such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and certain types of veterans’ coverage</li>
              <li>Coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan, including COBRA and retirement coverage</li>
              <li>Coverage purchased in the individual marketplace</li>
              <li>Coverage under a grandfathered health plan</li>
              <li>Other coverage recognized by HHS as meeting minimum essential coverage requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Minimum Essential Coverage:</strong>
              The type of coverage an individual needs to have to meet the individual responsibility requirement under the Affordable Care Act. This includes individual market policies, job-based coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP,TRICARE and certain other coverage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Exemptions:</strong>
              (REQ) Some individuals are exempt from the individual minimum coverage requirements. These include: certain religious sects; nonresidents of the United States; people in jail; those who cannot afford coverage; members of Indian tribes; taxpayers below the (verify this is income tax) income tax filing threshold; and people with coverage gaps of up to three months.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Shared Responsibility Payment:</strong>
              Individuals who fail to get coverage or qualify for an exemption are required to file a shared responsibility payment when they file their individual income tax return.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Dependents:</strong>
              A taxpayer also has responsibility for his or her dependents in some cases. The ACA uses the IRS definition of a dependent. If the dependent could be claimed under IRS rules, whether or not the dependent was actually claimed, the taxpayer has responsibility for providing minimum essential coverage. Married couples who file jointly are jointly responsible for any shared responsibility payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Penalties:</strong>
              Penalties apply to individuals who do not provide minimal essential coverage for themselves or their dependents.

                <strong>What You Should Do:</strong>
                If you offer qualified coverage, it is the responsibility of your employees to make sure they obtain minimum essential coverage.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What’s Ahead:</strong>
                Proposed rules for individual minimum coverage have been issued by both theTreasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.They are seeking comments on these proposals until May of 2013. Check back with us for updates about the final rules.

            </div>
            <p class='page-break blue health-insurance-exchanges'>Health insurance exchanges are being developed in each state to offer individuals and small employers affordable care.</p>
            <p>The ACA also provides for state-based health insurance exchanges, or online marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses can shop for coverage. Each state has the option of operating its own exchange or partnering with the federal government to run an exchange. If a state doesn’t choose to do either, it will become part of a federally-facilitated exchange. The exchanges are in the process of becoming operational by October 1, 2013.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Online Consumer Marketplace:</strong>
              Beginning with enrollment on October 1 of 2013, each state is required to have an exchange set up to sell coverage to individuals and small employers.The exchanges are meant to allow consumers to compare prices on standardized policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Kansas And Missouri:</strong>
              (REQ) Both states have decided not to offer their own healthcare exchange, so their exchanges have defaulted to be operated by the federal government.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Penalties For Large Employers:</strong>
              The ACA provides for penalties against employers if a certain number of their employees choose to buy insurance from the state exchange rather than using the employer-sponsored plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Exchange Notification Requirements:</strong>
              Employers will be required to inform eligible employees of the health insurance exchange offered in the state and the availability of the premium tax credit.The notification must include an exchange service description, subsidy availability in the event an affordable, minimum-value plan is not offered, and premium/ tax implications of purchasing on the exchange. However, the requirement will not go into effect until regulations are issued.

            <p class='blue'>In most cases, employers are now required to provide a health plan to their employees (play or pay).</p>
            <p>The biggest change for large employers is the new requirement, or mandate, that employers with 50 or more FTEs offer health benefits to their full-time workers. In the law itself, this provision is referred to as employer shared responsibility. You might hear this provision referred to as “play or pay,” meaning that employers that choose not to participate will have to pay a fine.</p>
            <p>Basically, businesses with more than 50 full-time equivalents employees (FTEs) will have to provide affordable qualified health insurance coverage to their full-time employees and their dependents. Businesses that do not offer plans will pay a penalty if ever one full-time employee receives a Federal exchange subsidy.</p>

              <strong>Minimum Value:</strong>
              Employers meet min value if the plan offered pays at least 60 percent of an employee’s healthcare expenses.That means coverage must have an actuarial value of at least 60 percent, with the employee paying at most 40 percent through deductibles and copayments.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Affordable Coverage:</strong>
              Coverage must also offer affordable coverage as defined by of the Affordable Care Act. That means a worker does not have to pay more than 9.5 percent of his or her household income for the insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Minimum Value Calculator:</strong>
              The federal government has provided a minimum value calculator where employers can enter plan information and find out whether their plan meets minimum value.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Actuarial Value (AV):</strong>
              This calculation measures how much a plan covers versus how much an individual might have to pay out-of-pocket.The actuarial value is based on a hypothetical population, not on the actual usage of individuals enrolled in the plan. Employers can use contributions to health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts to increase the actuarial value of a plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Minimum Essential Coverage:</strong>
              The federal government proposed regulations for minimum essential coverage on February 1, 2013. For large and small groups, this coverage includes fully-insured and self-insured plans offered by employers including government plans, any other coverage offered on the market, or health plans grandfathered under the ACA.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Failure to Offer Minimum Coverage:</strong>
              Beginning in 2014, an employer that doesn’t provide at least 95 percent of full-time employees with health coverage can be assessed $2000 a year for each employee. This penalty is triggered when an employee receives a premium tax credit for purchasing coverage from an exchange.The penalty applies to employers with more than 30 full-time employees.

            <p class='required-to-provide-an-plan-meets-minimum-value'>
              <strong>Coverage is Offered but Does not Provide Minimum Value:</strong>
              Employers that do offer at least 95 percent of the full-time employees (and after 2014, their dependents) with coverage, but that coverage is not that is not affordable or that fails to provide minimum value can be fined the greater of $3000 for each employee that takes a tax credit or $2000 for each full-time employee beyond the first 30 full-time employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Dependents:</strong>
              A dependent under the employer mandate includes a son or daughter (whether by blood or adoption), a stepson or stepdaughter, or an eligible foster child. Dependents will include children under age 27 in 2014. Spouses are not considered dependents.

            <p>
              <strong>Full-Time Employee (FTE):</strong>
              A full-time employee is someone who is employed an average of at least 30 hours a week or for 130 hours a month.There are no penalties for not providing coverage to part-time workers.

            <h3>Key Terms and Definitions</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Actuarial Value (AV):</strong>
              This calculation measures how much a plan covers versus how much an individual might have to pay out-of-pocket.The actuarial value is based on a hypothetical population, not on the actual usage of individuals enrolled in the plan. Employers can use contributions to health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts to increase the actuarial value of a plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Affordable Care Act (ACA):</strong>
              The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act commonly called Obamacare or the healthcare reform law, was signed into law on March 23, 2010. Its goals are to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. It provides mandates, subsidies and tax credits to employers and individuals, with additional reforms aimed at improving healthcare outcomes and streaming healthcare services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Affordable Coverage:</strong>
              Coverage must also meet an affordability standard as defined by the Affordable Care Act. That means workers do not have to pay more than 9.5 percent of their income for their insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Annual Dollar Limits:</strong>
              Group health plans can no longer set lifetime dollar limits or annual dollar limits on any individual’s coverage for essential health benefits, a group of services defined under the ACA. Most small group and individual plans will have to cover all of these services, while large group and grandfathered plans do not have to provide them. However, any plan that offers any of the essential benefit services cannot impose annual or lifetime limits on them.
            </p>

              Employers with more than 200 employees must automatically enroll new and existing full- time employees in health insurance coverage, but employees may opt out. Beginning in 2014, waiting periods longer than 90 days are not permitted for new employees. Employees must be given adequate notice in case they want to opt out.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Consumer Assistance Program (CAP):</strong>

            <p>
              <strong>Employer-sponsored Coverage Reporting:</strong>

            <p>
              <strong>Essential Health Benefits (EHB):</strong>

Most individual and small group plans are required to cover all of these categories starting in 2014.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Exchange Notification Requirement:</strong>
              Employers will be required to inform eligible employees of the health insurance exchange offered in the state and the availability of the premium tax credit.The notification must include an exchange service description, subsidy availability in the event an affordable, minimum-value plan is not offered, and premium/ tax implications of purchasing on the exchange.

              Beginning in 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services will charge health insurance carriers an excise tax for all plans regardless of how they are funded.This tax will help to fund the Affordable Care Act’s implementation. It is estimated that the tax will be less than 2.4 percent.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>External Appeal:</strong>
              If the plan still denies payment after considering an appeal, the consumer is entitled to appeal to an independent review organization.

              <strong>Flexible Spending Account (FSA):</strong>
              A flexible spending account is one of several types of accounts that can allow employees to reduce taxes.They generally allow employees to set aside a portion of their earnings to pay for qualified healthcare expenses. Money deducted from a FSA is not subject to payroll taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Full-time Employee:</strong>
              Under the ACA, a full-time employee is one that worked on average at least 30 hours a week, which translates to 130 hours of service in a calendar month.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Full-time Equivalent Employee (FTE):</strong>
              To figure out how many full-time equivalent employees a company has, add the hours worked by all part-time employees and divide that number by 120. For example: a company has 36 part-time workers that work an average of 100 hours a week, so that company must add an additional 30 workers to its full-time count. (36 part-time workers x 100 hours ÷120 = 30 FTEs).

              <strong>Habilitative Services:</strong>
              While rehabilitative services help people recover skills they have lost, habilitative services help people acquire new skills they have never had, such as speech therapy for an autistic child or helping a mentally ill person improve social skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Health Insurance Exchanges:</strong>
              The ACA provides for state- based health insurance exchanges, or online marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses can shop for coverage. Each state has the option of operating its own exchange or partnering with the federal government to run an exchange. If a state doesn’t choose to do either, it will become part of a federally-facilitated exchange.
