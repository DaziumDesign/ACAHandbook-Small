							<h3 class='ess-determine-your-size'>Determine Your Size</h3>

							<p>Historically, Blue KC, like other plans, considered small employers to be those with 2 to 99 employees. Under the Affordable Care Act, this definition has changed. However, with the introduction of the ACA, small employers are generally considered to be those with 1-50 employees. </p>

							<h4>Are You a Small Employer?</h4>
							<p>Here’s a quick way to tell if you fall into the small employer category. If you do, you can follow the links in the following chart to get more information about the requirements, penalties, taxes, fees and notifications that apply to small employers with 1-50 employees.</p>

							<h4>Where to Start.</h4>
							<p>The new law includes two sets of rules: one for large businesses and another for small businesses. This guide includes advice for businesses that fall into the small employer category. </p>
							<!-- <a href='#todo' class='large-button'>Large Employer Guide</a> -->
						</div>
						<div class='page sect-0 pg-f'>
							<h4 style="padding-top: 30px">Are You in the Small Employer Category?</h4>
							<p>The small group category under the ACA generally applies to businesses with an average of one but not more than 100 employees during business days of the preceding calendar year and who had at least one employee on the first day of the plan. However, the ACA also permits states to define group size. Currently, both Kansas and Missouri define small employers as those with 1-50 employees. This definition will continue in 2014 and 2015. </p>

							<p>If you fit into this size definition, you are eligible to take advantage of our small group products, and must comply with ACA provisions for small groups.</p>

							<p>There are special provisions for businesses with fewer than 25 employees. Sole proprietors are not considered small businesses, but are covered by the provisions of individual plans. </p>

							<h3 class="ess-grandfathered-plans">Grandfathered Plans</h3>

							<p>The ACA allowed for plans and benefits that were in effect on March 23, 2010 to be kept, or in other words, “grandfathered.” Newly-offered plans with effective dates after March 23, 2010 cannot be grandfathered. </p>

							<p><a href='#todo'>Grandfathered plans</a> do not have to comply with all of the provisions of the ACA, but they must provide certain benefits to their members if they were not already in place. These plans are exempt from many requirements including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>They do not have to cover preventive services without <a href='#todo'>cost-sharing</a></li>
								<li>They do not have to cover <a href='#todo'>essential health benefits</a></li>
								<li>They do not have to provide for an external or internal appeals process, but state laws may apply</li>
								<li>They do not have to comply with annual <a href='#todo'>out-of-pocket maximum</a></li>
								<li>They do not have to allow direct access to an OB/GYN without a referral</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>The patients’ rights included in any grandfathered plan:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>No lifetime <a href='#todo'>annual dollar limits</a> on coverage</li>
								<li>No <a href="#todo">rescission</a> of coverage if people accidentally made a mistake on an application</li>
								<li>Extension of parents’ coverage to include young adults under the age of 26</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class='page sect-0 pg-h'>

							<p style="padding-top: 30px"><strong>Grandfathered plans cannot make these specific changes:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Eliminating or reducing benefits</li>
								<li>Increasing <a href='#todo'>cost-sharing</a></li>
								<li>Reducing the employer contribution toward the premium </li>
							</ul>
							<p>If a plan makes one of those changes below grandfathered status is removed, and the plan must comply with other provisions of the ACA.</p>
							<p>Blue KC maintains grandfathered plans for applicable individual members and large groups (51 or more employees).</p>

									Overall individual lifetime dollar maximums and lifetime dollar limits on human organ transplants have been removed from our plans. Annual dollar maximum on durable medical equipment and annual dollar maximum on routine preventive care limits have been removed from our plans. Since Kansas and Missouri have essential health benefit benchmark plans, we continue to analyze current dollar limits and will remove any limits that exist for essential health benefits.

							<p>The Affordable Care Act is changing the world of health insurance both for small employers and for the healthcare marketplace in general.</p> 

							<p>This section is a big-picture overview of those changes, with specific details about how the new healthcare arena impacts small employers. </p>

							<p>The Affordable Care Act established what it calls a shared responsibility for federal and state governments, insurers, employers, and individuals to improve the availability, quality and affordability of health insurance coverage. Beginning in 2014, each individual in the United States has a shared responsibility as well to get basic health insurance, or minimum essential coverage.</p>

							<h2 class="overview-title-0">Health Insurance Coverage is Changing</h2>

							<p>The Affordable Care Act established what it calls a shared responsibility for federal and state governments, insurers, employers, and individuals to improve the availability, quality and affordability of health insurance coverage. Beginning in 2014, each individual in the United States has a shared responsibility to get basic health insurance, or minimum essential coverage. However, firms that have fewer than 50 employees are exempt from the employers shared responsibility provisions.</p>

							<h3>COVERAGE OVERVIEW</h3>
							<p>
								Each individual is now responsible for getting basic healthcare coverage (minimum essential coverage).
							</p>
							<p>
								The ACA requires each individual in the United States to obtain minimal essential coverage as part of the individual’s shared responsibility for healthcare. An individual may obtain that coverage from a variety of sources. In some cases, an individual can apply for an exemption or make a shared responsibility payment to the IRS when filing federal taxes.
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>Basic health coverage required for each individual:</strong> It is the responsibility of employees and all Americans to obtain some sort of health coverage. They can get the type of coverage that best meets their needs, including:
								<ul>
									<li>Coverage under a federal program such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and certain types of veterans’ coverage</li>
									<li>Coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan, including COBRA and retirement coverage </li>
									<li>Coverage purchased in the individual marketplace</li>
									<li>Other coverage recognized by HHS as meeting minimum essential coverage requirements</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h4>Minimum Essential Coverage</h4>
							<p>
								The type of coverage an individual needs to have to meet the individual responsibility requirement under the Affordable Care Act. This includes individual market policies, job-based coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE and certain other coverage.
							</p>

							<h4>Exemptions</h4>
							<p>
								Some individuals are exempt from the individual minimum coverage requirements. These include: certain religious sects; nonresidents of the United States; people in jail; those who cannot afford coverage; members of Indian tribes; taxpayers below the income tax filing threshold; and people with coverage gaps of up to three months. 
							</p>

							<h4>Shared Responsibility Payment</h4>
							<p>
								Individuals who fail to get coverage or qualify for an exemption are required to file a shared responsibility payment when they file their individual income tax return. 
							</p>

							<h4>Dependents</h4>
							<p>
								In some cases, a taxpayer also has responsibility for his or her dependents. The ACA uses the IRS definition of a dependent. If the dependent could be claimed under IRS rules, whether or not the dependent was actually claimed, the taxpayer has responsibility for providing minimum essential coverage. Married couples who file jointly are jointly responsible for any shared responsibility payment.
							</p>

							<h4>Penalties</h4>
							<p>
								A shared responsibility payment will apply to individuals who do not provide minimal essential coverage for themselves or their dependents. 
							</p>

							<h4>Individual Marketplace Premium Tax Credit</h4>
							<p>
								Beginning in plan years that start on or after January 1, 2014, individuals may be eligible for tax credits, commonly referred to as subsidies, for insurance they purchase through the individual marketplace exchanges. Blue KC does not directly administer the tax credit, but understands the tax credit may impact the buying choices of individual customers.
							</p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li>
									<strong>Coverage Overview Starting Date:</strong> beginning in plan years that start after January 1, 2014.
								</li>

								<li>
									<strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Shared responsibility does not apply to firms with fewer than 50 employees, although you may qualify for tax credits if you decide to provide coverage. 
								</li>

								<li>
									<strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> this provision begins in 2014.
								</li>
							</ul>


							<h3>SHARED RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
							<p>Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government, state governments, insurers, employers, and individuals share the responsibility to reform and improve the availability, quality, and affordability of health insurance coverage in the United States. </p>

							<p>Employers with 50 or more full-time, including full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, have a shared responsibility under the ACA. Employers are not required to provide coverage to their employees under the Affordable Care Act. However, beginning in 2014, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees (including FTEs) that do not offer health insurance that is 1) affordable and 2) provides a minimum level of coverage to substantially all of their full-time employees (and their dependents) may be subject to an employer shared responsibility payment. If an employer does not offer a plan to every full-time employee, and even one employee receives tax-subsidized coverage through an individual exchange, the employer must pay a penalty for every full-time employee. Consult your tax or legal advisor to answer detailed questions for Employer Mandate.</p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Shared Responsibility Starting Date:</strong> 2014</li>
								<li><strong>What Should You Do:</strong> If your business has 50 or more full-time equivalent employees, determine if you want to offer healthcare insurance and make sure you understand the tax implications if you do not. Businesses with fewer than 50 full-time, including FTE, employees do not need to offer coverage, but may be eligible for tax credits if they do.</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> This provision goes into effect in 2014.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>EXCHANGES</h3>
							<p>Health insurance exchanges are being developed in each state to offer individuals and small employers affordable healthcare coverage. </p>
							<p>The Affordable Care Act also provides for state- and federal-based health insurance exchanges, or online marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses can shop for coverage. Each state has the option of operating its own exchange or partnering with the federal government to run an exchange. If a state doesn’t choose to do either, it will become part of a federally-facilitated exchange. Across the nation, the exchanges are in the process of becoming operational by October 1, 2013. </p>
							<h4>Online Consumer Marketplace</h4>
							<p>Beginning with open enrollment on October 1, 2013, each state is required to have an exchange set up to sell coverage to individuals and small employers. The exchanges are meant to allow consumers to compare prices on standardized policies. </p>
							<h4>Kansas and Missouri</h4>
							<p>Both states have decided not to offer their own healthcare exchange, so their exchanges have defaulted to be operated by the federal government.</p>
							<h4>Exchange Notification Requirements</h4>
							<p>Employers will be required to inform eligible employees of the health insurance exchange offered in the state and the availability of the premium tax credit. The notification must include an exchange service description; subsidy availability in the event an affordable, minimum-value plan is not offered; and premium/tax implications of purchasing on the exchange. However, the requirement will not go into effect until further guidance is issued. </p>
							<h4>Actuarial Value (AV)</h4>
							<p>The percent paid by a health plan of the percentage of the total allowed costs of benefits. ACA designates four tiers of health plans available for purchase through the exchanges. Each tier is defined by its actuarial value and include the following levels:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Bronze health plan is a health plan that has an AV of  60 percent</li>
								<li>Silver health plan has an AV of 70 percent</li>
								<li>Gold health plan has an AV of 80 percent</li>
								<li>Platinum health plan has as an AV of 90 percent</li>
								<li>The value may vary by plus or minus 2 percent</li>
							</ul>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Exchanges Starting Date:</strong> October 1, 2013</li>
								<li><strong>What Should You Do:</strong> Prepare for the notification requirements by monitoring this document for updates. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> The exchanges are being created now with the intent of being fully operational by October 1, 2013.</li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> We will keep you up to date on the exchange notification, and help you comply with its provisions.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH OPTIONS PROGRAM</h3>
							<p>In addition to the individual marketplace exchange, the ACA is also establishing the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchange. While small businesses are not required to offer insurance, the designers of the act include potential tax credits to encourage small businesses to participate. </p>
							<p>In 2014 and 2015, employers with 1-50 employees are  eligible to participate on the SHOP, but can also purchase healthcare coverage on private exchanges, like Blue KC’s BlueKCExchange.com.</p>
							<h4>Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP)</h4>
							<p>This program is part of the new healthcare marketplaces, also known as exchanges. Similar to BlueKCExchange.com, the SHOP exchange will allow business owners to see a comparison of plans, what they cover, and their cost so they can choose the level of coverage they want to offer their employees. </p>
							<h4>Which Businesses Are Eligible To Enroll In SHOP?</h4>
							<p>In 2014 and 2015, businesses with 1-50 employees are eligible to enroll. In 2016, businesses of up to 100 employees will be allowed to enroll. Even if a business grows larger than 50 or 100 employees, it can remain in the program once it is enrolled.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Enrollment begins October 1, 2013 for coverage beginning January 1, 2014.</li>
								<li><strong>How to enroll:</strong> Through a broker or directly through the SHOP.</li>
							</ul>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Small Business Health Options Program Starting Date:</strong> Enrollment begins October 1, 2013 for coverage in 2014. </li>
								<li><strong>Small Business Size:</strong> Businesses with 50 or less employees can enroll in SHOP. In 2016, the program is open to businesses with 100 or less employees.</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> The SHOP programs will be set up under the state exchanges beginning in October 2013.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>NETWORK ADEQUACY</h3>
							<p>Plans that are available in the exchange must offer a sufficient choice of providers (network adequacy).The plans that are offered through healthcare exchanges must offer a network of providers that has a sufficient number and types of providers to ensure members get care without unreasonable delays. </p>
							<h4>Qualified Health Plan (QHP)</h4>
							<p>An insurance plan that is certified by an exchange, provides essential health benefits, follows established limits on cost-sharing such as deductibles, copayments, and out-of-pocket maximum, and meets other requirements.</p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Network Adequacy Starting Date:</strong> Plan years starting January 1, 2014 and after.</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC guarantees network adequacy in all of its plans offered on the exchanges.</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> The provision takes effect on January 1, 2014. </li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> Blue KC will offer networks that meet adequacy rules in the new 2014 products, and migration to these products will take place at time of renewal for small groups and January 1, 2014 for non-grandfathered individual plans).</li>
							</ul>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>GUARANTEED ISSUE</h3>
							<p>No one can be denied coverage (guaranteed issue). Health insurance companies will be required to offer and renew coverage to individuals regardless of their health status, pre-existing conditions, or services they have used. </p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li>Guaranteed Issue Starting Date: in plan years starting after January 1, 2014.</li>
								<li>What’s Ahead: This provision takes effect in plan years starting after January 1, 2014.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>TAX CREDITS AND  GRANTS</h3>
							<p>The Affordable Care Act does not require that businesses provide health insurance, but it offers tax credits to encourage qualified small businesses to start or continue to offer health plans.  </p>
							<p>One of the goals of the Affordable Care Act is to increase affordable, quality healthcare for small businesses. It is supposed to do this in two ways: by offering small businesses a tax credit to help them pay for health insurance, and by offering affordable healthcare options through the Small Business Health Options program (SHOP). </p>
							<h4>Tax Credit for Eligible Small Businesses</h4>
							<p>To be eligible, small businesses must have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees; annual wages paid must be below $50,000 per employee; and they must contribute 50 percent or more toward their employees’ premiums. </p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>2010-2013:</strong> Employers that qualify can get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of their contribution toward the employees’ premiums. The credit is determined using a formula of annual wages and the number of employees. </li>
								<li><strong>2014-beyond:</strong> Once the SHOP exchanges are in place, employers that purchase insurance through them may get a tax credit of up to 50 percent of their contribution. The exact amount of the tax credit will be calculated based on the number of employees and average wages. </li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Grants for Wellness Programs</h4>
							<p>Small businesses, in this case defined as those with fewer than 100 employees who work an average of 25 hours a week, can apply for grants to start workplace wellness programs. Businesses that had wellness programs in effect on or before March, 23 2010 are not eligible for the grants.</p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Tax Credits & Grants Starting Date:</strong> The tax credit is 35 percent in 2013 and will go up to 50 percent in 2014 for qualified small business that participate in the SHOP exchanges. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> The Small Business Tax Credit increases to 50 percent in 2014</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>MODIFIED COMMUNITY RATING</h3>
							<p>A new formula called <strong>Modified Community Rating (MCR or Adjusted Community Rating)</strong> will be used to set rates. Beginning in 2014, insurance companies must use modified community rating to price their products for individuals and groups with 1-50 employees. </p>
							<p>Under MCR, all policyholders in the same community (which can be an entire state or part of a state) must pay the same premium regardless of their personal health or the carrier selected. Costs can be adjusted only on the basis of family size, location, tobacco use, and age.</p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Modified Community Rating Starting Date:</strong> Plan years starting January 1, 2014 and after.</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC will adjust rates based on age, geographic location, smoking status, and family coverage tier per ACA guidelines. This changes the rating factors we have used to-date and completely changes composite rated groups rates.</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> This provision takes effect on  January 1, 2014. </li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> Blue KC will incorporate the rating requirements into the new products to be sold beginning on January 1, 2014.</li>

							<h3>SHOP EXCHANGE</h3>
							<p>Small businesses will be able to compare prices and plans using the new Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP Exchange).</p>
							<p>These exchanges are being set up on the state level, and small businesses will have the option of shopping for insurance through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) or on private exchanges, like BlueKCExchange.com. </p>
							<h4>Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP or SHOP exchange)</h4>
							<p>This program is part of the new healthcare marketplace, also known as exchanges. Similar to BlueKCExchange.com, the federally-facilitated SHOP exchange will allow small businesses to see a comparison of plans, what they cover and their cost so they can choose the level of coverage they want to offer their employees. </p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Starting Date:</strong> Enrollment begins October 1, 2013 for coverage in 2014. </li>
								<li><strong>Small Business Size:</strong> Businesses with fewer than 50 employees can enroll in the SHOP. In 2016, the program is open to businesses with fewer than 100 employees.</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> The SHOP programs will be set up under the state exchanges beginning in October 2013 (Some states will setup their own exchange, but, in the case of Missouri and Kansas, these states will operate on the federally-facilitated Exchange).</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>ESSENTIAL HEALTH BEENFITS</h3>
							<p>The Affordable Care Act defines certain benefits as Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and prohibits small group plans from setting lifetime or annual limits on them.</p>
							<p>Most individual and small group plans are required to cover all of the EHB categories starting in 2014, and they must also remove annual and lifetime limits.</p>
							<h4>Categories of Essential Health Benefits</h4>
							<p>The ACA defines 10 general categories of essential health benefits: </p>
							<ol>
								<li>Ambulatory patient services</li>
								<li>Emergency services</li>
								<li>Hospitalization</li>
								<li>Laboratory services</li>
								<li>Maternity and newborn care</li>
								<li>Mental health and substance abuse services including behavioral health treatment</li>
								<li>Prescription drugs</li>
								<li>Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices</li>
								<li>Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management</li>
								<li>Pediatric services, including oral and vision care</li>
							</ol>

							<h4>Habilitative Services</h4>
							<p>While rehabilitative services help people recover skills they have lost, habilitative services help people acquire new skills they have never had, such as speech therapy for an autistic child, or helping a mentally ill person improve social skills.</p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Essential Health Benefits Starting Date:</strong> Essential health benefit requirements become effective for each plan on the first day of the plan year after January 1, 2014. </li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC has already removed dollar limits based upon our interpretation of the essential health benefits. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> Blue KC will continue to monitor and make changes as required by the ACA.</li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> Blue KC will incorporate EHBs in the new 2014 products, and migration to these products will take place at time of renewal for small employers and January 1, 2014 for non-grandfathered individual plans.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>PREVENTIVE SERVICES</h3>
							<p>The Affordable Care Act requires that plans make certain preventive care or wellness services available without coinsurance, copays or deductibles if the services are provided in-network. </p>
							<h4>Cost-sharing Must Be Eliminated</h4>
							<p>Health plans must now provide coverage for preventive care without any cost-sharing. Cost-sharing is defined as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. This provision applies only to services provided by healthcare professionals who are in the plan’s network. </p>
							<h4>Preventive Services Defined</h4>
							<p>The act defines preventive services as yearly preventive care visits for adults and all standard immunizations. In certain age groups, additional preventive care services include: colorectal cancer screening; cholesterol and lipid disorders; screening for certain sexually transmitted diseases including HIV; high blood pressure, diabetes and depression screening; screening or counseling from a primary care provider for diet and nutrition, obesity, substance abuse and tobacco use. </p>
							<h4>Grandfathered Plans</h4>
							<p>Grandfathered plans are not required to remove coinsurance, copays or deductibles from preventive care services.  Blue KC maintains grandfathered plans for applicable individuals and large groups (51 or more employees).</p>
							<h4>Women’s Preventive Services</h4>
							<p>An additional group of women’s preventive services are required to be covered without cost-sharing for services provided in-network. These include: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Mammography screening for adult women</li>
								<li>Genetic screening and evaluation for the breast cancer gene</li>
								<li>Pap smears</li>
								<li>Screening for sexually-transmitted diseases; certain screenings for pregnant women</li>
								<li>Osteoporosis screening for women over age 60</li>
								<li>Counseling for women at high risk for breast cancer</li>
								<li>Breast-pump supplies and counseling</li>
								<li>Domestic violence screening and counseling</li>
								<li>FDA-approved contraception</li>
								<li>Human papillomavirus screening for women over age 30</li>
								<li>Well-women visits</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Non-Discrimination In Wellness Incentive Programs</h4>
							<p>The act also prohibits discrimination in health-contingent wellness programs that generally require individuals to meet a specific standard related to their health to obtain a reward.</p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Preventive Services Starting Date:</strong> The preventive care rules took effect in 2010. The prohibition on cost-sharing for women’s preventive plans took effect on renewal after August 1, 2012. Non-discrimination in wellness plans takes effect for plans effective on or after January 1, 2014. </li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC will help guide you in modifying your plan if necessary. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> Changes in non-discrimination take effect in 2014. </li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> Blue KC will help guide you on your wellness incentive plans to ensure they are nondiscriminatory.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS</h3>
							<p>Flexible spending accounts (FSA), health savings accounts (HSA) and health reimbursement accounts (HRA) can no longer be used for over-the-counter medications without a prescription, and pre-tax contributions are capped.</p>
							<p>Since 2011, plans have been prohibited from allowing employees to use these accounts to pay for over-the-counter medications without a prescription. Beginning in 2013, employer contributions to HSAs will be capped at $2,500 a year per plan. Going forward, the limit will be adjusted each year for the cost of living.</p>
							<h4>Flexible Spending Account (FSA)</h4>
							<p>A flexible spending account is one of several types of accounts that allows employees to pay for qualified healthcare expenses with pre-tax dollars. They generally allow employees to set aside a portion of their earnings to pay for these qualified healthcare expenses. Money deducted from a FSA is not subject to payroll taxes. Generally, FSA funds do not rollover unspent funds from one year to the next.</p>
							<h4>Health Savings Account (HSA)</h4>
							<p>A medical savings account available to taxpayers who are enrolled in a high deductible health plan. An HSA allows the member or the member’s employer to contribute funds into the member’s account on a pre-tax basis. The funds can then be used for qualified healthcare expenses. The funds contributed to the account are not subject to federal income tax at the time of deposit. Funds must be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Unlike a Flexible Spending Account (FSA), HSA funds continue to rollover year after year if they are not used. HSAs are subject to a cap on contributions each year.</p>
							<h4>Qualified Healthcare Expense</h4>
							<p>The Affordable Care Act established a new uniform standard for what is reimbursable from flexible spending accounts (FSA), health savings accounts (HSA), and health reimbursement arrangements (HRA). </p>
							<p>Money that is withdrawn from an HSA is tax free when used to pay for qualified medical expenses. In general, these are expenses to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental defect of illness, including dental and vision expenses.</p>
							<p>Over-the-counter drugs and medications are only reimbursable if purchased with a prescription. This rule does not, however, apply to reimbursement for the cost of insulin, which is reimbursable even if purchased without a prescription. The new rules does not apply to items for medical care that are not medicines or drugs, so equipment such as crutches, bandages, and diagnostic devices such as blood sugar test kits still qualify for reimbursement with or without a prescription. Copays and deductibles continue to be reimbursable. </p>
							<p>The IRS has a list of qualified medical expenses on its website. (http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/index.html)</p>
							<h4>Employee Reimbursement</h4>
							<p>Employees that want to be reimbursed for these charges need to submit copies of their prescriptions and receipts for qualified expenses.</p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Health Spending Accounts Starting Date:</strong> The provisions for over-the-counter medications have been in place since 2011, and the cap on contributions became effective in 2013. </li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> These provisions have been in place since 2011 and the beginning of 2013. Make sure employees understand they need to submit both a copy of their prescription and receipt to be reimbursed. </li>
							</ul>

							<h3>WAITING PERIODS</h3>
							<p>Waiting periods for employee enrollment cannot exceed 90 days. Small group plans cannot impose a waiting period of more than 90 days for employees to enroll in coverage. </p>
							<p>Waiting periods are the time that must pass before coverage can become effective for an employee or dependent, who is otherwise eligible for coverage under a job-based health plan.</p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Waiting Periods Staring date:</strong> Final regulations around waiting periods have not been issued.</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC will assist you with this provision. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> Final regulations around waiting periods have not been issued.</li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> We will change the waiting period provisions of policies, if necessary, at time of renewal. Additional waiting period options will be available and the employer can work with their marketing representatives to facilitate a change if the default option is not desired.</li>

							<h3>RIGHT TO AFFORDABLE COVERAGE </h3>
							<p>Coverage must be considered affordable and must offer minimum value as defined by the Affordable Care Act. That means an individual obtaining coverage through an employer with 50 or more employees should not have to spend more than 9.5 percent of their incomes as their share of the premium. Coverage must also meet the test of minimum value, meaning that the plan must pay at least 60 percent of the employee’s expected healthcare costs.</p>
							<h3>SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND COVERAGE</h3>
							<p>Each person enrolled in a small group plan should have a summary of benefits and coverage. </p>
							<h4>Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC)</h4>
							<p>Health insurance issuers and group health plans are required to provide those enrolled with an easy-to-understand summary about a health plan’s benefits and coverage. They must give enrollees a plain-language summary of benefits and coverage document, which follows a standard format so that consumers can easily compare their options. Consumers should also receive a uniform glossary of terms commonly used in the plan. </p>
							<p>The summary of benefits and coverage should include deductibles, covered services and cost-sharing for common medical issues. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Summary of Benefits and Coverage Starting Date:</strong> September 23, 2012</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> SBCs have been in effect since 2012. </li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> SBCs are provided for all fully insured and Cost-Plus clients.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>RIGHT TO APPEAL</h3>
							<p>The Affordable Care Act ensures each enrollee the right to appeal health insurance plan decisions to deny payment for a service or treatment. New rules that apply to health plans created after March 23, 2010 provide for an internal appeal. </p>
							<h4>Requirements for Notification</h4>
							<p>If a plan denies a claim, it must notify the member of the reason the claim was denied, their right to file an internal appeal, their right to an external review if their internal appeal fails, and how to get help from a consumer assistance program if one exists in the state. </p>
							<h4>Internal Appeal</h4>
							<p>A plan member requesting an internal appeal must receive  a decision within 72 hours if the appeal is the denial of a  claim for urgent care. The plan has 30 days to respond to a  non-urgent appeal, and 60 days to respond to a denial of service that has already been provided. </p>
							<h4>External Appeal</h4>
							<p>If the plan still denies payment after considering an appeal, the consumer is entitled to appeal to an Independent Review Organization (IRO). </p>
							<h4>Consumer Assistance Program (CAP)</h4>
							<p>The ACA offered grants to states to start or strengthen consumer assistance programs. Consumer Assistance Programs are currently in operation in both Kansas and Missouri. The state CAP may help consumers file appeals. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Right to Appeal Starting Date:</strong> March 23, 2010</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Appeals processes should already be in place for most plans.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>RIGHT TO CHOOSE</h3>
							<p>Members may choose any primary care doctor or pediatrician from their health provider’s network. </p>
							<p>Any individual enrolled in a plan must be able to choose a primary care physician, including pediatricians for children. Additional rules prohibit health plans from requiring a referral from a primary care provider before members can seek coverage for obstetrical or gynecological (OB-GYN) care from a participating OB-GYN specialist. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Right to Choose Starting Date:</strong> March 23, 2010</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> These provisions have been in place since 2010. </li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> Similar to Blue KC PPO plans, those enrolled in Blue-Care HMO network may select any primary care physician currently accepting patients. Members do not need approval to see other specialists including OB/GYNs within our networks. </li>
							</ul>
							<h3>EMERGENCY SERVICES </h3>
							<p>Plans cannot limit payment for out-of-network emergency services. The Affordable Care Act requires member copayment and coinsurance to be the same whether emergency care is provided by an in-network or out of network provider. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Out-of-network Emergency Services Starting Date:</strong>  March 23, 2010</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> These provisions have been in place since 2010.</li>
								<li><strong>Grandfathered plans:</strong> Change not required.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS</h3>
							<p>Plans cannot retroactively cancel coverage because an enrollee made a mistake on his or her application. </p>
							<p>In the past, insurance companies could retroactively cancel, or rescind, coverage if an applicant put false or inaccurate information on an application. The Affordable Care Act prohibits plans from rescinding coverage if the false or inaccurate information was caused by an honest mistake. This provision applies to all plans. An insurance company must also give members 30-days notice that it plans to rescind coverage. </p>

							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Pre-existing Conditions Starting Date:</strong> March 23, 2010</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> These provisions have been in place since 2010.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>EXCLUSIONS</h3>
							<p>Large employer plans cannot exclude employees, spouses or dependents under the age of 19 based on pre-existing conditions. Beginning in 2014, the same provision applies to enrollees and dependents of any age. Grandfathered plans must comply with this regulation. </p>
							<h4>Coverage of Dependent Children</h4>
							<p>Beginning in 2015, if an employer offers coverage to  full-time employees, the employer must also offer coverage to dependents under the age of 26. Employers do not need to offer coverage to the spouse of a dependent. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Exclusions Starting Date:</strong> 2010 for dependents under 19; 2014 for all ages. </li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Work with your marketing representative to make this change for 2104. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> The ban on excluding pre-existing conditions begins in 2014 for all plans. </li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> Blue KC will incorporate the removal of pre-existing condition exclusion periods at time of renewal. </li>
							</ul>

							<h3>CAP ON EXPENSES </h3>
							<p>A cap will be imposed on out-of-pocket expenses for individuals covered under a small group plan.</p>
							<p>Employer-sponsored health plans may not have out-of-pocket maximums that exceed $6,400 (individual and $12,500 family) and all member cost-sharing must be counted against the maximum. Except in limited circumstances, deductibles for small group plans cannot exceed $2,000 for individual coverage or $4,000 for family coverage.</p>
							<h4>Out-of-pocket Expenses</h4>
							<p>The costs the member must pay in a plan year before his or her health insurance or plan begins to pay 100 percent of the allowed amount. This limit cannot include the premium, balance-billed charges or healthcare the health insurance or plan doesn’t cover. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Cap on Expenses Starting Date:</strong> Plan years starting January 1, 2014 and after.</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC will help you make this change at renewal.</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> Out-of-pocket maximums go into effect for plans that take effect in 2014 and beyond.</li>
								<li><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> Blue KC will incorporate the new deductible rule in the new 2014 products and migration to these products will take place at time of renewal for small group and January 1, 2014 for non-grandfathered individual plans. </li>

							<h2 class="overview-title-3">Taxes, Fees & Penalties</h2>
							<h3>EMPLOYER MANDATE (PLAY OR PAY PENALTY)</h3>
							<p>Small businesses are not required to offer health insurance to their employees. However, beginning in 2014, businesses with 50 or more full-time, including full-time equivalent, employees may have to pay a penalty if their coverage does not meet both the affordability and minimum value requirements of the ACA. You can avoid paying this penalty by ensuring that your coverage meets the affordability and minimum value requirements.</p>
							<h4>Affordability</h4>
							<p>A healthcare plan is considered affordable if the employee’s share of the premium for employee-only coverage does not exceed 9.5 percent of his or her household income as reported on the employee’s W-2.</p>
							<h4>Minimum Value (MV)</h4>
							<p>This test requires that the plan must pay at least 60 percent of the employee’s expected healthcare costs. The employee would then be anticipated to pay the other 40 percent through copayments, deductibles and coinsurance.  </p>
							<p>The plan is considered to provide minimum value if the percentage of allowed costs (out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and copays) paid by the plan and not by the employee is at least 60 percent of allowed costs on an aggregate basis. It should be noted that this percentage is not calculated on the basis of any one individual employee, but rather is calculated based on national utilization data. HHS has provided a convenient calculator which may be accessed online at this website. (http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/regulations/index.html.)</p>
							<h4>What Triggers a Penalty</h4>
							<p>The penalty is triggered when any full-time employee receives a tax credit, commonly called a subsidy, so that he or she can purchase insurance through an exchange rather than using the employer’s insurance plan. </p>
							<h4>The Penalty</h4>
							<p>Employers with 51-99 employees can be charged $3000 per employee receiving the tax credit, or $2000 per employee excluding the first 30 workers, whichever is less. </p>
							<h4>Exemptions</h4>
							<p>Businesses with 50 or fewer full-time employees, including FTE employees, are exempt from the penalty. There is no penalty for part-time employees who are not offered coverage. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Penalties Starting Date:</strong> 2014</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Consult your tax or legal advisor</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Coming Up:</strong> The provision begins in 2014</li>
								<li><strong>How Can Blue KC Help:</strong> Blue KC has verified that all of our small employer plans cover at least 60% of the value of the cost of the benefits.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>EXCISE TAX</h3>
							<p>Beginning in 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will charge health insurance carriers an excise tax for all plans regardless of how they are funded. This tax will help to fund the Affordable Care Act’s implementation. It is estimated that the tax will be less than 2.4 percent.</p>
							<p><strong>Cadillac tax:</strong> A 40 percent excise tax will be applied to  high-cost “Cadillac” plans. This tax is imposed on health insurers on the aggregate values of employer-sponsored coverage for an employee that exceeds threshold amounts of $10,200 for self-only coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. This tax will begin in 2019 and be applied to the 2018 tax year. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Excise Tax Starting Date</strong>: September 20, 2014</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do</strong>: Blue KC will handle this. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Coming Up</strong>: Rates will be adjusted each year. </li>
								<li><strong>How Can Blue KC Help</strong>: Blue KC will pay the fee that is pro-rated for 2013 and 2014. The excise tax fee will appear on all rate sheets for renewals and quotes. </li>
							</ul>

							<h3>COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS FEE</h3>
							<p>Since 2012, a cost effectiveness fee has been added to all group insurance coverage. This fee supports the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute. The fee rose from $1 multiplied by the average number of individuals covered to $2 in 2013.</p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Comparative Effectiveness Fee Starting Date:</strong> 2012</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do</strong>: Blue KC pays the fee for fully-insured groups; self-funded groups, including Cost Plus, are required to pay the fee annually to the IRS.</li>
								<li><strong>How Can Blue KC Help</strong>: Blue KC pays the fee for fully-insured groups; self-funded groups, including Cost Plus, are required to pay the fee directly to the IRS.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>TEMPORARY REINSURANCE</h3>
							<p>The Temporary Reinsurance Program is funded by all health insurance insurers and third-party administrators (TPA). It (not sure what “it” is) makes reinsurance payments to health insurance insurers that cover high-risk members in the individual market (excluding grandfathered plans). It will be maintained from 2014 through 2016, the first three years of exchange operation.</p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Temporary Reinsurance Program Starting Date:</strong> Tax year 2012 when returns are filed in 2013</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Prepare to make a report if your business filed more than 250 W-2s in 2011, and continue to monitor this document for updates. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Coming Up:</strong> The size of businesses required to make this report may change in the future. </li>
								<li><strong>How Can Blue KC Help:</strong> Blue KC will assist employers with certification on minimal value, including a disclaimer.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>REBATES FOR CONSUMERS</h3>
							<p>Since 2011, the Affordable Care Act has required insurance companies to spend a specified percentage of premium dollars on medical care and quality improvement activities to meet a medical loss ratio (MLR) standard. Insurance companies that are not meeting the MLR standard were required to provide rebates to their consumers beginning in 2012. </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Rebates for Consumers Starting Date:</strong> 2011</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Return annual size verification surveys to Blue KC to ensure your business is in the proper small or large group category which determines MLR standards and applicable rebates.</li>

							<h2 class="overview-title-4">Notifications & Reporting</h2>
							<h3>REPORTING AND NOTIFICATION</h3>
							<p>Employers must report to the federal government on the coverage they provide to full-time employees. They must also notify their employees of what they reported to the federal government. </p>
							<h4>Employer-sponsored Coverage Reporting</h4>
							<p>The reporting must include certification of minimum value. The report must include: whether minimum essential coverage is offered to full-time employees; monthly premiums for the lowest-cost option in each category; employer share of total allowed cost of the plan; the number of full-time employees for each month; and the month each full-time employee was covered. </p>
							<h4>Notification To Eligible Employees</h4>
							<p>The employer must provide all full-time employees with a report that shows: the name and address of their plan; contact information for the plan; all information reported for the employee and dependents as part of employee-sponsored coverage reporting.</p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Reporting and Notification Starting Date:</strong> 2014</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC will assist you with this. </li>
								<li><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> This provision begins in plans years starting after January 1, 2014.</li>
								<li><strong>How Can Blue KC Help:</strong> Blue KC will assist employers with certification of minimum value. </li>
							</ul>
							<h3>SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND COVERAGE</h3>
							<p>Health insurance issuers and group health plans are required to provide those enrolled with an easy-to-understand Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC). They must give enrollees a short, plain-language summary of benefits and coverage document, which follows a standard format so that consumers can compare their options. Consumers should also receive a uniform glossary of terms commonly used in the plan. </p>
							<p>The summary of benefits and coverage should include deductibles, covered services and cost-sharing for common medical issues.  </p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Summary of Benefits and Coverage Starting Date:</strong> September 23, 2012</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> SBCs have been in effect since 2012.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>COVERAGE NOTIFICATION</h3>
							<p>Each employer must make a report to the IRS including</p>
							<ul>
								<li>If minimum essential coverage is provided to full-time employees</li>
								<li>Waiting periods</li>
								<li>Monthly cost for the lowest cost option in each category</li>
								<li>The employer share of the total allowed cost of the plan</li>
								<li>The number of full-time employees for each month</li>
								<li>Name, address, TIN/SSN for each full-time employee</li>
								<li>The month each full-time employee was covered</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Notification to eligible employees of Employer-sponsored Coverage</h4>
							<p>Each employer must notify its eligible employees of the following: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>The health plan’s name, address and contact person</li>
								<li>All information the employer reported for the eligible employee and dependents as part of the employer-sponsored coverage requirement.</li>
							</ul>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Coverage Notification Starting Date:</strong> Must be in place by January 31, 2015</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Monitor this document for more information</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Coming Up:</strong> This provision goes into effect in 2014. </li>
								<li><strong>How Can Blue KC Help:</strong> We will keep you updated on this requirement. </li>
							</ul>
							<h3>EXCHANGE NOTIFICATION</h3>
							<h4>Health Insurance Marketplace/Exchange Notification</h4>
							<p>Employers will be required to inform eligible employees of the health insurance marketplace/exchange offered in the state, and the availability of the premium tax credit. The notification must include an exchange service description, subsidy availability in the event an affordable, minimum-value plan is not offered, and premium/tax implications of purchasing on the exchange. However, the requirement will not go into effect until regulations are issued.</p>
							<ul class="lined-border">
								<li><strong>Exchange Notification Starting Date:</strong> Delayed</li>
								<li><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Monitor this document for more information</li>
								<li><strong>What’s Coming Up:</strong> Exchange notification will be required at some point in the future. </li>
								<li><strong>How Can Blue KC Help:</strong> We will keep you updated on this requirement.</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>W-2 Reporting of Employer-sponsored Coverage</h4>
							<p>The ACA requires employers to report the cost of coverage under an employer-sponsored group health plan. However, reporting the cost of healthcare coverage on the W-2 form does not mean that the coverage is taxable; the reporting is required information for the employees, and to allow them to make comparisons on the cost for their coverage.  </p>
							<p>The value of the employer’s excludable contribution to health coverage continues to be excludable from an employee’s income, and it is not taxable. This reporting is for informational purposes only and will provide employees useful and comparable consumer information on the cost of their healthcare coverage.</p>

							<h3 class="overview-title-5">Key Terms and Definitions</h3>
							<p class='kt-actuarial-value'>
								<strong>Actuarial Value (AV):</strong>
								This calculation measures how much a plan covers versus how much an individual might have to pay out-of-pocket. The actuarial value is based on a hypothetical population, not on the actual usage of individuals enrolled in the plan. Employers can use contributions to health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts to increase the actuarial value of a plan. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_affordable_care_act'>
								<strong>Affordable Care Act (ACA):</strong>
								The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act commonly called Obamacare or the healthcare reform law, was signed into law on March 23, 2010. Its goals are to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. It provides mandates, subsidies and tax credits to employers and individuals, with additional reforms aimed at improving healthcare outcomes and streaming healthcare services. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_affordable_coverage'>
								<strong>Affordable Coverage:</strong>
								In order to be considered Minimum Essential Coverage, in addition to meeting a minimum value, coverage must also meet an affordability standard as defined by the Affordable Care Act. That means workers do not have to pay more than 9.5 percent of their income for their insurance. 
							</class=p>
							<p class='kt_modified_community_rating'>
								<strong>Adjusted Community Rating or Modified Community Rating (MCR):</strong>
								A new formula called Modified Community Rating (MCR or Adjusted Community Rating) will be used to set rates. Beginning in 2014, insurance companies must use modified community rating to price their products for individuals and groups with 1-50 employees. Under MCR, all policyholders in the same community (which can be an entire state or part of a state) must pay the same premium regardless of their personal health or the carrier selected. Costs can be adjusted only on the basis of family size, location, tobacco use, and age.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_annual_dollar_limits'>
								<strong>Annual Dollar Limits:</strong>
								Group health plans can no longer set lifetime dollar limits or annual dollar limits on any individual’s coverage for essential health benefits, a group of services defined under the ACA. Most small group and individual plans will have to cover all of these services, while large group and grandfathered plans do not have to provide them. However, any plan that offers any of the essential benefit services cannot impose annual or lifetime limits on them.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_automatic_enrollment'>
								<strong>Automatic Enrollment:</strong>
								Employers with more than 200 employees must automatically enroll new and existing full-time employees in health insurance coverage, but employees may opt out. Beginning in 2014, waiting periods longer than 90 days are not permitted for new employees. Employees must be given adequate notice in case they want to opt out.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_cadillac_tax'>
								<strong>Cadillac Tax:</strong>
								see High Cost Excise Tax.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_comparative_effectiveness_fee'>
								<strong>Comparative Effectiveness Fee:</strong>
								Since 2012, a cost effectiveness fee has been added to all group insurance coverage. This fee supports the Patient Center Outcomes Research Institute. The fee rose from $1 multiplied by the average number of individuals covered to $2 in 2013.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_consumer_assistance_program'>
								<strong>Consumer Assistance Program (CAP):</strong>
								The ACA offered grants to states to start or strengthen consumer assistance programs. Consumer Assistance Programs are currently in operation in both Kansas and Missouri. The state CAP may help consumers file appeals. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_cost_sharing'>
								<strong>Cost-sharing (Out-of-pocket Expenses):</strong>
								Cost-sharing is defined as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. This provision applies only to services provided by healthcare professionals who are in the plan’s network. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_dependents'>
								<strong>Dependents:</strong>
								A dependent under the employer mandate includes a son or daughter (whether by blood or adoption), a stepson or stepdaughter, or an eligible foster child. Dependents include children under age 26 after 2014. Spouses are not considered dependents. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_employer_mandate'>
								<strong>Employer Mandate:</strong>
								Under the ACA, most large employers, with more than 51 employees are required to offer health benefits to their employees or pay a penalty. This is also referred to as “play or pay.”
							</p>
							<p class='kt_employer_sponsored_coverage_reporting'>
								<strong>Employer-sponsored Coverage Reporting:</strong>
								The reporting must include certification of minimum value and a disclaimer. The report must include: whether minimum essential coverage is offered to full-time employees; monthly premiums for the lowest-cost option in each category; employer share of total allowed cost of the plan; the number of full-time employees for each month; the month each full-time employee was covered.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_essential_health_benefits'>
								<strong>Essential Health Benefits (EHB):</strong>
								The Affordable Care Act defines certain insurance benefits as essential health benefits. EHBs must include items and services within at least the following 10 categories:
								ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care. Most individual and small group plans are required to cover all of these categories starting in 2014. Large group plans do not have to cover essential health benefits, but they must remove annual and lifetime limits. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_exchange_notification_requirement'>
								<strong>Exchange Notification Requirement:</strong>
								Employers will be required to inform eligible employees of the health insurance exchange offered in the state, and the availability of the premium tax credit. The notification must include an exchange service description, subsidy availability in the event an affordable, minimum-value plan is not offered, and premium/tax implications of purchasing on the exchange.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_exchanges'>
								<strong>Exchanges:</strong>
								see Health Insurance Exchanges.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_excise_tax'>
								<strong>Excise Tax:</strong>
								Beginning in 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services will charge health insurance carriers an excise tax for all plans regardless of how they are funded. This tax will help to fund the Affordable Care Act’s implementation. It is estimated that the tax will be less than 2.4 percent.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_external_appeal'>
								<strong>External Appeal:</strong>
								If the plan still denies payment after considering an appeal, the consumer is entitled to appeal to an independent review organization. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_flexible_spending_account'>
								<strong>Flexible Spending Account (FSA):</strong>
								A flexible spending account is one of several types of accounts that allows employees to pay for qualified healthcare expenses with pre-tax dollars. They generally allow employees to set aside a portion of their earnings to pay for these qualified healthcare expenses. Money deducted from a FSA is not subject to payroll taxes. Generally, FSA funds do not rollover unspent funds from one year to the next. A list of qualified medical expenses can be found on the IRS website.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_full_time_employee'>
								<strong>Full-time Employee:</strong>
								Under the ACA, a full-time employee is one that worked on average at least 30 hours a week, which translates to 130 hours of service in a calendar month. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_full_time_equivalent_employee'>
								<strong>Full-time Equivalent Employee (FTE):</strong>
								To figure out how many full-time equivalent employees a company has, add the hours worked by all part-time employees and divide that number by 120 for each month. For example:
								a company has 36 part-time workers that work an average of 100 hours a month, so that company must add an additional 30 workers to its full-time count. (36 part-time workers x 100 hours ÷120 = 30 FTEs). If your company has special circumstance you should consult your tax or legal advisor.  If total employees, full-time plus FTE, is greater than 50, a company is considered a large employer for purposes of the employer mandate.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_grandfathered_plans'>
								<strong>Grandfathered Plans:</strong>
								Plans that were already in effect on March 23, 2010 do not have to comply with all of the provisions of the ACA, but they must provide certain benefits to their members if they were not already in place. Blue KC maintains grandfathered plans for applicable individuals and large groups (51 or more employees).
							</p>
							<p class='kt_guaranteed_issue'>
								<strong>Guaranteed Issue:</strong>
								Health insurance companies will be required to offer and renew coverage to individuals regardless of their health status, pre-existing conditions, or services they have used. 
							</p>
							<p class='kt_habilitative_services'>
								<strong>Habilitative Services:</strong>
								While rehabilitative services help people recover skills they have lost, habilitative services help people acquire new skills they have never had, such as speech therapy for an autistic child or helping a mentally ill person improve social skills.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_health_insurance_exchanges'>
								<strong>Health Insurance Exchanges:</strong>
								The ACA provides for state-based health insurance exchanges, or online marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses can shop for coverage. Each state has the option of operating its own exchange, or partnering with the federal government to run an exchange. If a state doesn’t choose to do either, it will become part of a federally-facilitated exchange.
							</p>

								<strong>Health Savings Account (HSA):</strong>
								A medical savings account available to taxpayers who are enrolled in a high deductible health plan. An HSA allows the member or the member’s employer to contribute funds into the member’s account on a pre-tax basis. The funds can then be used for qualified healthcare expenses. The funds contributed to the account are not subject to federal income tax at the time of deposit. Funds must be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Unlike a Flexible Spending Account (FSA), HSA funds continue to rollover year after year if they are not used.

The type of coverage an individual needs to have to meet the individual responsibility requirement under the Affordable Care Act. This includes individual market policies, job-based coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, and certain other coverage (waiting for legal confirmation on content). Most small group and individual plans will have to cover all of these services, while large group and grandfathered plans do not have to provide them. However, any plan that offers any of the essential benefit services cannot impose annual or lifetime limits on them.
							</p>
							<p class='kt_minimum_essential_coverage'>
								<strong>Minimum Essential Coverage:</strong>
								A plan fails to provide minimum value if the plan’s share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan is less than 60 percent of those costs.

							</p>
							<p class='kt_minimum_value'>
								<strong>Minimum Value (MV):</strong>
								The plan is considered to provide minimum value if the percentage of allowed costs (out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and copays) paid by the plan and not by the employee is at least 60 percent of allowed costs on an aggregate basis. It should be noted that this percentage is not calculated on the basis of any one individual employee, but rather is calculated based on national utilization data. HHS has provided a convenient calculator which may be accessed online at this website.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Modified Community Rating (MCR or Adjusted Community Rating):</strong>
								A new formula called Modified Community Rating (MCR or Adjusted Community Rating) will be used to set rates.

Over-the-counter drugs and medications are only reimbursable if purchased with a prescription. This rule does not, however, apply to reimbursement for the cost of insulin, which is reimbursable even if purchased without a prescription. The new rules does not apply to items for medical care that are not medicines or drugs, so equipment such as crutches, supplies such as bandages, and diagnostic devices such as blood sugar test kits still qualify for reimbursement with or without a prescription.
