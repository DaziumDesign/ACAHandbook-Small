					<p>In most cases, the provision becomes effective when your plan year begins. For example, if the provision becomes effective on January 1, 2014, it most often becomes effective when your plan year begins the next time after January 1, 2014.</p>

					<ol>
						<li class="one">Overall individual lifetime dollar maximums and lifetime dollar limits on human organ transplants have been removed from our plans. Annual dollar maximum on durable medical equipment and annual dollar maximum on routine preventive care limits have been removed from our plans.

					<h3>Determining Your Size</h3>
					<p>The starting point for businesses to understand the Affordable Care Act is figuring out their size. The new law includes two sets of rules: one for large businesses and another for small businesses. This guide includes advice for businesses that fall into the large employer category. An additional guide for small businesses will be issued separately.</p>

					<h3>Are you a large employer?</h3>
					<p>Here’s a quick way to tell if you fall into the large employer category. If you do, you can follow the links in the following chart to get more information about the requirements, penalties, taxes, fees and notifications that apply to large employers.</p>

					<h3>How To Determine Your Size</h3>
					<p>First things first. If you have 50 or more full-time employees, you fit into the large business category and are subject to the provisions, penalties, taxes and fee, and notifications for large employers.</p>
					<p>A large employer is one that has at least 50 full-time employees or a combination of part-time employees that are equivalent to 50 based upon the hours of service for all employees.</p>

					<p><strong>Full-time Employee:</strong> Under the ACA, a full-time employee is one that worked on average at least 30 hours a week. Another way of defining full-time employee under the ACA is an employee that averages 130 hours of service in a calendar month.</p>

					<p><strong>Full-time Equivalent Employee (FTE):</strong> To figure out how many full-time equivalent employees a company has, add the hours worked by all part-time employees and divide that number by 120. For example: a company has 36 part-time workers that work an average of 100 hours a week, which translates to an additional 30 FTWs for that company. (36 part-time workers x 100 hours &divide; 120 = 30 FTEs). If your company has special circumstances, you should consult your tax advisor.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="page sect-0 pg-j">
					<h3>Grandfathered Plans</h3>
					<p>When the ACA was passed, the government promised Americans they could keep their current healthcare plan if they were happy with it. Thus the ACA “grandfathered” plans that were in effect on March 23, 2010 (the day the law went into effect) to allow them to keep the plans and benefits they already had. This provision mostly affects people in large group plans.</p>
					<p>Grandfathered plans do not have to comply with all of the provisions of the ACA, but they must provide certain benefits to their members if they were not already in place.</p>

					<p>The patients’ rights that must be included in any grandfathered plan include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>No lifetime limits on coverage and no annual dollar amount restrictions</li>
						<li>No recission of coverage if people accidentally made a mistake on an applications</li>
						<li>Extension of parents’ coverage to include young adults under the age of 26</li>
					</ul>

					<p>However, those existing plans cannot make certain changes including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Eliminating or reducing benefits</li>
						<li>Increasing cost-sharing</li>
						<li>Reducing the employer contribution toward the premium</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If a plan makes one of those changes, it must also comply with other provisions of the ACA</p>

					<h2>Overview Of The ACA</h2>
					<h3>What the ACA means to Large Employers</h3>

					<p>The Affordable Care Act is changing the world of health insurance both for large employers and for the healthcare marketplace in general.</p>
					<p>This section is a big-picture overview of those changes, with specific details about how the new healthcare arena impacts large employers.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="page sect-1 pg-auto pg-2" data-auto-pagination="true" >
					<h3>How Health Insurance Coverage is Changing</h3>
					<p>The Affordable Care Act established what it calls a shared responsibility for federal and state governments, insurers, employers, and individuals to improve the availability, quality and affordability of health insurance coverage. Beginning in 2014, each individual in the United States has a shared responsibility as well to get basic health insurance, or minimum essential coverage.</p>
					<strong class="blue">Each individual is now responsible for getting basic healthcare coverage (minimum essential coverage).</strong>
					<p>The ACA requires each individual in the United States to obtain basic health coverage (minimal essential coverage) as part of the individual’s shared responsibility for healthcare. An individual may obtain that coverage from a variety of sources. In some cases, an individual can apply for an exemption or make a shared responsibility payment to the IRS when filing federal taxes.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Basic health coverage required for each individual:</strong></p>
					<p>It is the responsibility of employees and all Americans to obtain some sort of health coverage.They can get the type of coverage that best meets their needs, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Coverage under a federal program such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and certain types of veterans’ coverage</li>
						<li>Coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan, including COBRA and retirement coverage</li>
						<li>Coverage purchased in the individual marketplace</li>
						<li>Coverage under a grandfathered health plan</li>
						<li>Other coverage recognized by HHS as meeting minimum essential coverage requirements</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Minimum Essential Coverage:</strong> The type of coverage an individual needs to have to meet the individual responsibility requirement under the Affordable Care Act. This includes individual market policies, job-based coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP,TRICARE and certain other coverage.</p>
					<p><strong>Exemptions:</strong> Some individuals are exempt from the individual minimum coverage requirements. These include: certain religious sects; nonresidents of the United States; people in jail; those who cannot afford coverage; members of Indian tribes; taxpayers below the income tax filing threshold; and people with short coverage gaps of up to three months.</p>
					<p><strong>Shared Responsibility Payment:</strong> Individuals who fail to get coverage or qualify for an exemption are required to file a shared responsibility payment when they file their individual income tax return.</p>
					<p><strong>Dependents:</strong> A taxpayer also has responsibility for his or her dependents in some cases. The ACA uses the IRS definition of a dependent. If the dependent could be claimed under IRS rules, whether or not the dependent was actually claimed, the taxpayer has responsibility for providing minimum essential coverage. Married couples who file jointly are jointly responsible for any shared responsibility payment.</p>
					<p><strong>Penalties:</strong> Penalties apply to individuals who do not provide minimal essential coverage for themselves or their dependents.</p>

					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>STARTING DATE: 2014</strong></p>
						<p><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> If you offer qualified coverage, it is the responsibility of your employees to make sure they obtain minimum essential coverage.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> Proposed rules for individual minimum coverage have been issued by both theTreasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.They are seeking comments on these proposals until May of 2013. Check back with us for updates about the final rules.</p>
					</div>
					<p class="blue">Health insurance exchanges are being developed in each state to offer individuals and small employers affordable care.</p>
					<p>The ACA also provides for state-based health insurance exchanges, or online marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses can shop for coverage. Each state has the option of operating its own exchange or partnering with the federal government to run an exchange. If a state doesn’t choose to do either, it will become part of a federally-facilitated exchange.The exchanges are in the process of becoming operational by October 1, 2013. Missouri and Kansas did not signal their intention to set up an exchange or partner with the federal government, so both states have defaulted to become part of the federal exchange.</p>
					<p><strong>Online Consumer Marketplace:</strong> By October 1 of 2013, each state is required to have an exchange set up to sell coverage to individuals and small employers.The exchanges are meant to allow consumers to compare prices on standardized policies.</p>
					<p><strong>Kansas And Missouri:</strong> Both states have decided not to offer their own healthcare exchange, so their exchanges will be operated by the federal government.</p>
					<p><strong>Penalties For Large Employers:</strong> The ACA provides for penalties against employers if a certain number of their employees choose to buy insurance from the state exchange rather than using the employer-sponsored plan.</p>

					<p><strong>Exchange Notification Requirements:</strong> Employers will be required to inform eligible employees of the health insurance exchange offered in the state and the availability of the premium tax credit.The notification must include an exchange service description, subsidy availability in the event an affordable, minimum-value plan is not offered, and premium/ tax implications of purchasing on the exchange. However, the requirement will not go into effect until regulations are issued.</p>
					<p><strong>Actuarial Value (AV):</strong>The act designates creates four tiers of health plans available for purchase through the Exchanges. Each tier is defined by its actuarial value, or percent paid by a health plan of the percentage of the total allowed costs of benefits.They include the following levels:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Bronze health plan is a health plan that has an AV of 60 percent</li>
						<li>Silver health plan has an AV of 70 percent</li>
						<li>Gold health plan has an AV of 80 percent</li>
						<li>Platinum health plan has as an AV of 90 percent. The value may vary by plus or minus 2 percent.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>STARTING DATE: OCTOBER 1, 2013</strong></p>
						<p><strong>What Should You Do:</strong> Prepare for the notification requirements by monitoring this document for updates.</p>
						<p><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong>The exchanges are supposed to be working by October 1, 2013.</p>
						<p><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> We will keep you up to date on the exchange notification and help you comply with its provisions.</p>
					</div>

					<p class="blue">No one can be denied coverage (guaranteed issue).</p>
					<p>Health insurance companies will be required to offer and renew coverage to individuals regardless of their health status, pre-existing conditions, or services they have used.</p>
					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>STARTING DATE: 2014</strong></p>
						<p><strong>What Should You Do:</strong> ???</p>
						<p><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> This provision takes effect in plan years starting after January 1, 2014.</p>
						<p><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> ???</p>
					</div>

					<p class="blue">In most cases, employers are now required to provide a health plan to their employees (play or pay).</p>
					<p>The biggest change for large employers is the new requirement, or mandate, that most businesses offer health benefits to their workers. In the law itself, this provision is referred to as employer shared responsibility. You might hear this provision referred to as “play or pay,” meaning that employers that choose not to participate will have to pay a fine.</p>
					<p>Basically, businesses with more than 50 full-time equivalents employees (FTEs) will have to provide qualified health insurance coverage to their full-time employees and their dependents. Businesses that do not offer plans will pay a penalty.</p>
					<p>HOW TO DETERMINE YOUR COMPANY’S SIZE (icon link)</p>

					<p><strong>If you provide coverage, what’s required?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Qualified coverage:</strong> The act defines qualified coverage as a plan that pays at least 60 percent of an employee’s healthcare expenses.That means coverage must have an actuarial value of at least 60 percent, with the employee paying at most 40 percent through deductibles and copayments.</p>
					<p><strong>Affordable coverage:</strong> Coverage must also offer minimum value under the definition of the Affordable Care Act. That means a worker does not have to pay more than 9.5 percent of his or her income for the insurance.</p>
					<p><strong>Minimum value:</strong> The federal government will provide a minimum value calculator where employers can enter plan information and find out whether their plan provides minimum value, which is a test of affordable coverage.</p>
					<p><strong>Actuarial value (Av):</strong> This calculation measures how much a plan covers versus how much an individual might have to pay out-of-pocket.The actuarial value is based on a hypothetical population, not on the actual usage of individuals enrolled in the plan. Employers can use contributions to health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts to increase the actuarial value of a plan.</p>
					<p><strong>Minimum essential coverage:</strong> The federal government proposed regulations for minimum essential coverage on February 1, 2013. For large and small groups, this coverage includes fully-insured and self-insured plans offered by employers including government plans, any other coverage offered on the market, or health plans grandfathered under the ACA.</p>

					<p><strong>Penalties if the plan is not comprehensive or affordable:</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Failure to offer minimum coverage:</strong> Beginning in 2014, an employer that doesn’t provide at least 95 percent of full-time employees with health coverage can be assessed $2000 a year for each employee that declines the company plan and instead chooses to get coverage through a state exchange.This penalty is triggered when an employee receives a premium tax credit for purchasing coverage from an exchange.The penalty applies to employers with more than 30 full-time employees.</p>
					<p><strong>Coverage is offered but does not provide minimum value:</strong> Employers that do provide at least 95 percent of the full-time employees (and after 2014, their dependents) with coverage, but that coverage is not that is not affordable or that fails to provide minimum value can be fined $3000 for each employee that takes a tax credit or $2000 for each full-time employee beyond the first 30 full-time employees.</p>
					<p><strong>Dependents:</strong> A dependent under the employer mandate includes a son or daughter (whether by blood or adoption), a stepson or stepdaughter, or an eligible foster child. Dependents will included include children under age 27 in 2014. Spouses are not considered dependents.</p>
					<p><strong>Full-time employee (FTE):</strong> A full-time employee is someone who is employed an average of at least 30 hours a week or for 130 hours a month.There are no penalties for not providing coverage to part-time workers.</p>

					<p><strong>If you don’t provide coverage, what are the penalties?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Penalty for not providing coverage:</strong> If businesses do not choose to provide coverage, they may have to pay a penalty. The penalties kick in when more than 30 full-time employees instead purchase coverage through one of the new state health insurance exchanges.The penalties for 2014 are estimated at $2000.The amount of the assessment will be adjusted in future years.</p>
					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>STARTING DATE</strong></p>
						<p>2014 after January of the date your plan starts</p>
						<p><strong>What should you do:</strong> The mandate does not take effect until 2014, but companies might want to use the IRS information now to determine if they are subject to the provisions and to assess the penalties if they don’t opt in. Ensure that you have policies and procedures in place to track the number of full-time and part-time employees and their hours of service.</p>
						<p><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> The IRS published a proposed rule in January of 2013 spelling out the details of the regulation and has set a hearing date for April 23, 2013. This provision remains controversial and critics are pushing for a change in the proposed language. We are waiting for the federal government to issue a minimum value calculator.

					<h3 class="page-break">Key Issues For Large Employers Throughout The Implementation Of Healthcare Reform</h3>
					<p class="blue">The Affordable Care Act defines certain benefits as essential health benefits and prohibits large group plans from setting lifetime or annual limits on them.</p>
					<p>The Affordable Care Act defines certain insurance benefits as essential health benefits. Most individual and small group plans are required to cover all of these categories starting in 2014. Large groups plans do not have to cover essential health benefits, but they must remove annual and lifetime limits. Grandfathered plans must remove lifetime limits but not annual limits.</p>
					<p><strong>Categories of essential health benefits:</strong> The ACA defines 10 general categories of essential health benefits: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; laboratory services; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance abuse services including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.</p>
					<p><strong>habilitative services:</strong> While rehabilitative services help people recover skills they have lost, habilitative services help people acquire new skills they have never had, such as speech therapy for an autistic child or helping a mentally ill person improve social skills.</p>

					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>STARTING DATE</strong></p>
						<p>Essential health benefit requirements become effective for each plan on the first day of the plan year after January 1, 2014.</p>
						<p><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC has already removed dollar limits based upon our interpretation of the essential health benefits.</p>
						<p><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> Blue KC will continue to monitor and make changes.</p>
						<p><strong>How Blue Kc Can Help:</strong> Overall individual lifetime dollar maximums and lifetime dollar limits on human organ transplants have been removed from our plans. Annual dollar maximum on durable medical equipment and annual dollar maximum on routine preventive care limits have been removed from our plans. Since Kansas and Missouri have essential health benefit benchmark plans, we continue to analyze current dollar limits and will remove any limits that exist for essential health benefits</p>
					</div>
					<p class="blue">Cost-sharing must be eliminated from most wellness and women’s preventive care plans.</p>
					<p>The Affordable Care Act requires that plans make certain preventive care or wellness services available without co- insurance, co-pays or deductibles if the services are provided in-network.This prohibition does not apply to grandfathered plans.</p>

					<p><strong>Cost-sharing must be eliminated:</strong> Non-grandfathered plans must now provide coverage for preventive care without any cost sharing. Cost-sharing is defined as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles.This provision applies only to services provided by healthcare professionals who are in the plan’s network.</p>
					<p><strong>Preventive services defined:</strong> The act defines preventive services as yearly preventive care visits for adults and all standard immunizations. In certain age groups, additional preventive care services include: colorectal cancer screening; cholesterol and lipid disorders; screening for certain sexually transmitted diseases including HIV; high blood pressure, diabetes and depression screening; screen or counseling from a primary care provider for diet and nutrition, obesity, tobacco use, substance abuse and tobacco use.</p>
					<p><strong>Grandfathered plans:</strong> Grandfathered plans are not required to remove coinsurance, copays or deductibles from preventive care services.</p>
					<p><strong>Women’s preventive services:</strong> An additional group of women’s preventive services are required to be covered without cost-sharing for services provided in-network.These include: mammography screening for adult women; genetic screening and evaluation for the breast cancer gene; Pap smears; screening for sexually-transmitted diseases; certain screenings for pregnant women; osteoporosis screening for women over age 60; counseling for women at high risk for breast cancer; breast-feeding supplies and counseling; domestic violence screening and counseling; FDA-approved contraception; human papillomavirus screening for women over age 30; and well-women visits.</p>

					<p><strong>Non-discrimination in wellness incentive programs:</strong> The act also prohibits discrimination in health-contingent wellness programs that generally require individuals to meet a specific standard related to their health to obtain a reward.</p>
					<p><strong>STARTING DATE</strong></p>
					<p>The preventive care rules took effect in 2010.The prohibition on cost-sharing for women’s preventive plans took effect on renewal after August 1, 2012. Non- discrimination in wellness plans takes effect for plans effective on or after January 1, 2014.</p>
					<p><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Blue KC will help guide you in modifying your plan if necessary.</p>
					<p><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> Changes in non-discrimination take effect in 2014. How Blue KC Can Help: Blue KC will help guide you on your wellness incentive plans to ensure they are nondiscriminatory.</p>
					<p>Flexible spending accounts can no longer be used for over-the-counter medications without a prescription and pre-tax contributions are capped.</p>
					<p>Since 2011, plans have been prohibited from allowing employees to use flexible spending accounts, health reimbursement agreements, retiree reimbursement and funded health reimbursement accounts, or Archer Medical Savings Accounts to pay for over-the-counter medications without a prescription. Employee contributions to health flexible spending accounts (FSAs) will be capped at $2,500 a year per plan year.The limit will be adjusted for the cost of living every year.</p>

					<p><strong>Flexible spending account (FSA):</strong> A flexible spending account is one of several types of accounts that can allow employees to reduce taxes.They generally allow employees to set aside a portion of their earnings to pay for qualified healthcare expenses. Money deducted from a FSA is not subject to payroll taxes.</p>
					<p><strong>Similar accounts covered by this provision:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Health Reimbursement Agreement (HRA)</li>
						<li>Health Savings Account (HSA)</li>
						<li>Retiree Reimbursement Account (RRA)</li>
						<li>Funded Health Reimbursement Accounts (FHRA)</li>
						<li>Archer Medical Savings Accounts</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Cap on employer contributions:</strong> Beginning in 2013, employers can no longer contribute more than $2500 as a salary reduction for an FSA.</p>
					<p><strong>Cap on individual contributions:</strong> While individuals were allowed to save $5000 in an FSA before 2013, the contribution of pre-tax savings is now capped at $2500.</p>
					<p><strong>Reimbursement:</strong> Employees that want to be reimbursed for these charges need to submit copies of their prescriptions and receipts.</p>
					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>STARTING DATE</strong></p>
						<p>The provisions on over-the-counter medications has been in place since 2011, and the cap of contributions became effective in 2013.</p>
					</div>

					<p><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> These provisions have been in place since 2011 and the beginning of 2013. Make sure employees understand they need to submit both a copy of their prescription and receipt to be reimbursed.</p>
					<p class="blue">Grandfathered plans do not have to meet all requirements of the ACA, but do have to make some changes.</p>
					<p>When the ACA was passed, the government promised Americans they could keep their current healthcare plan if they choose to do so. Thus the act “grandfathered” plans that were in effect on March 23, 2010 (when the law went into effect) to keep operating as they had before.This provision mostly affects people in large group plans. Grandfathered plans do not have to comply with all of the provisions of the ACA, but they must provide certain benefits to their members if they were not already in place.</p>
					<div class="box">
						<p><strong>MORE ABOUT GRANDFATHERED PLANS (icon link)</strong></p>
						<p><strong>STARTING DATE: MARCH 2010</strong></p>
						<p><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> Make sure changes to employer plans do not trigger the requirement to comply with other ACA provisions that do not generally apply for grandfathered plans.</p>
					</div>
					<p class="blue">In the future, employers will be given instructions for automatically enrolling new and existing employees in their plans.</p>

					<p>Employers with more than 200 employees must automatically enroll new and existing full-time employees in health insurance coverage, but employees may opt out. Beginning in 2014, waiting periods longer than 90 days are not permitted for new employees. Employees must be given adequate notice in case they want to opt out.</p>
					<p><strong>Full-time employee:</strong> While full-time employees are not defined under this provision, the employer mandate section of the law defines full-time as an employee who works an average of 30 hours a week.</p>

					<p>Plan members have a right to appeal when a plan denies payment.</p>
					<p>The Affordable Care Act ensures each enrollee the right to appeal health insurance plan decisions to deny payment for a service or treatment. New rules that apply to health plans created after March 23, 2010 provide for an internal appeal.</p>

					<p><strong>Requirements for notification:</strong> If a plan denies a claim, it must notify the member of the reason the claim was denied, their right to file a an internal appeal, their right to an external review if their internal appeal fails, and how to get help from a consumer assistance program if one exist in the state.</p>
					<p><strong>Internal appeal:</strong> A plan member requesting an internal appeal must receive a decision within 72 if the appeal is the denial of a claim for urgent care.The plan has 30 days to respond to a non-urgent appeal, and 60 days to respond to a denial of service that has already been provided.</p>
					<p><strong>External Appeal:</strong> If the plan still denies payment after considering an appeal, the consumer is entitled to appeal to an independent review organization.</p>
					<p><strong>Consumer assistance program (CAP):</strong> The ACA offered grants to states to start or strengthen consumer assistance programs. Consumer Assistance Programs are currently in operation in both Kansas and Missouri.The state CAP may help consumers file appeals.</p>
					<p><strong>Grandfathered plans:</strong> Grandfathered plans created before March 23, 2010 do not have to offer appeals or review rights.</p>

Employers can use contributions to health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts to increase the actuarial value of a plan.</p>
					<p><strong>Affordable Care Act (ACA):</strong> The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act commonly called Obamacare or the healthcare reform law, was signed into law on March 23, 2010. Its goals are to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. It provides mandates, subsidies and tax credits to employers and individuals, with additional reforms aimed at improving healthcare outcomes and streaming healthcare services.</p>
					<p><strong>Affordable Coverage:</strong> Coverage must also offer minimum value under the definition of the Affordable Care Act. That means workers do not have to pay more than 9.5 percent of their income for their insurance.</p>
					<p><strong>Annual Dollar Limits:</strong> Group health plans can no longer set lifetime dollar limits or annual dollar limits on any individual’s coverage for essential health benefits, a group of services defined under the ACA.
