							### Essential Information for Blue KC Large Group Plans and Brokers

							Many provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have already been implemented and have changed the healthcare marketplace.

							Over the next several years, additional important changes will take effect. Blue KC is monitoring those changes on a daily basis and is available to help you navigate the complex healthcare reform waters.

							We’ve developed this easy-to-use guide to allow you to understand the overall changes in the healthcare landscape, as well as the items that need your attention right now. This document will be regularly updated so that you have a timely resource for taking action to remain in compliance with the ACA legislation and with regulations that are still being written.

							As the leading health insurance provider in the Kansas City region for more than 75 years, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City (Blue KC) will continue to work in partnership with large employers and brokers.

							We hope you will find this document to be a useful resource and perhaps bookmark it to come back often for updates and explanations. As always, your Blue KC marketing representative is available to answer any questions about compliance with the Affordable Care Act.

						%footer The information provided is a summary of some ACA provisions, as of March 1, 2013. It is not intended to be comprehensive, and does not constitute legal advice.

						%h3 Determining Your Size
						%p The starting point for businesses to understand the Affordable Care Act is figuring out their size. The new law includes two sets of rules: one for large businesses and another for small businesses. This guide includes advice for businesses that fall into the large employer category. An additional guide for small businesses will be issued separately.
						%h3 Are you a large employer?

							First things first. If you have 50 or more full-time employees, you fit into the large business category and are subject to the provisions, penalties, taxes and fee, and notifications for large employers.

							**Full-time Employee:**
							Under the ACA, a full-time employee is one that worked on average at least 30 hours a week. Another way of defining full-time employee under the ACA is an employee that averages 130 hours of service in a calendar month.

							**Full-time Equivalent Employee (FTE):**
							To figure out how many full-time equivalent employees a company has, add the hours worked by all part-time employees and divide that number by 120. For example: a company has 36 part-time workers that work an average of 100 hours a week, which translates to an additional 30 FTWs for that company. (36 part-time workers x 100 hours &divide; 120 = 30 FTEs). If your company has special circumstances, you should consult your tax advisor.
					.page.sect-0.pg-j.grandfathered-plans
						%h3 Grandfathered Plans
						:markdown
							When the ACA was passed, the government promised Americans they could keep their current healthcare plan if they choose to do so. Thus the ACA “grandfathered” plans that were in effect on March 23, 2010 (the day the law went into effect) allow them to keep the plans and benefits they already had.

							Grandfathered plans do not have to comply with all of the provisions of the ACA, but they must provide certain benefits to their members if they were not already in place.

							The patients’ rights that must be included in any grandfathered plan include:

							* (REQ) No lifetime limits on coverage and no annual dollar amount restrictions
							* No recission of coverage if people accidentally made a mistake on an applications
							* Extension of parents’ coverage to include young adults under the age of 26

							However, those existing plans cannot make certain changes including:

							* Eliminating or reducing benefits
							* Increasing cost-sharing
							* Reducing the employer contribution toward the premium

							If a plan makes one of those changes, it will no longer have grandfathered status, and it must also comply with other provisions of the ACA.

						%h3{ :class => 'how-health-insurance-coverage-is-changing' } How Health Insurance Coverage is Changing
						%p The Affordable Care Act established what it calls a shared responsibility for federal and state governments, insurers, employers, and individuals to improve the availability, quality and affordability of health insurance coverage. Beginning in 2014, each individual in the United States has a shared responsibility as well to get basic health insurance, or minimum essential coverage.
						%strong.blue{ :class => 'minimum-essential-coverage' } Each individual is now responsible for getting basic healthcare coverage (minimum essential coverage).
						%p The ACA requires each individual in the United States to obtain minimal essential coverage as part of the individual’s shared responsibility for healthcare. An individual may obtain that coverage from a variety of sources. In some cases, an individual can apply for an exemption or make a shared responsibility payment to the IRS when filing federal taxes.
						%p
							%strong Basic health coverage required for each individual:
						%p It is the responsibility of employees and all Americans to obtain some sort of health coverage.They can get the type of coverage that best meets their needs, including:
						%ul
							%li Coverage under a federal program such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and certain types of veterans’ coverage
							%li Coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan, including COBRA and retirement coverage
							%li Coverage purchased in the individual marketplace
							%li Coverage under a grandfathered health plan
							%li Other coverage recognized by HHS as meeting minimum essential coverage requirements
						%p
							%strong Minimum Essential Coverage:
							The type of coverage an individual needs to have to meet the individual responsibility requirement under the Affordable Care Act. This includes individual market policies, job-based coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP,TRICARE and certain other coverage.
						%p
							%strong Exemptions:
							(REQ) Some individuals are exempt from the individual minimum coverage requirements. These include: certain religious sects; nonresidents of the United States; people in jail; those who cannot afford coverage; members of Indian tribes; taxpayers below the (verify this is income tax) income tax filing threshold; and people with coverage gaps of up to three months.
						%p
							%strong Shared Responsibility Payment:
							Individuals who fail to get coverage or qualify for an exemption are required to file a shared responsibility payment when they file their individual income tax return.
						%p
							%strong Dependents:
							A taxpayer also has responsibility for his or her dependents in some cases. The ACA uses the IRS definition of a dependent. If the dependent could be claimed under IRS rules, whether or not the dependent was actually claimed, the taxpayer has responsibility for providing minimum essential coverage. Married couples who file jointly are jointly responsible for any shared responsibility payment.
						%p
							%strong Penalties:
							Penalties apply to individuals who do not provide minimal essential coverage for themselves or their dependents.
						.box
							%p
								%strong STARTING DATE: 2014
							%p
								%strong What You Should Do:
								If you offer qualified coverage, it is the responsibility of your employees to make sure they obtain minimum essential coverage.
							%p
								%strong What’s Ahead:
								Proposed rules for individual minimum coverage have been issued by both theTreasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.They are seeking comments on these proposals until May of 2013. Check back with us for updates about the final rules.
						%p.page-break.blue.health-insurance-exchanges Health insurance exchanges are being developed in each state to offer individuals and small employers affordable care.
						%p The ACA also provides for state-based health insurance exchanges, or online marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses can shop for coverage. Each state has the option of operating its own exchange or partnering with the federal government to run an exchange. If a state doesn’t choose to do either, it will become part of a federally-facilitated exchange. The exchanges are in the process of becoming operational by October 1, 2013.
						%p
							%strong Online Consumer Marketplace:
							Beginning with enrollment on October 1 of 2013, each state is required to have an exchange set up to sell coverage to individuals and small employers.The exchanges are meant to allow consumers to compare prices on standardized policies.
						%p
							%strong Kansas And Missouri:
							(REQ) Both states have decided not to offer their own healthcare exchange, so their exchanges have defaulted to be operated by the federal government.
						%p
							%strong Penalties For Large Employers:
							The ACA provides for penalties against employers if a certain number of their employees choose to buy insurance from the state exchange rather than using the employer-sponsored plan.
						%p
							%strong Exchange Notification Requirements:
							Employers will be required to inform eligible employees of the health insurance exchange offered in the state and the availability of the premium tax credit.The notification must include an exchange service description, subsidy availability in the event an affordable, minimum-value plan is not offered, and premium/ tax implications of purchasing on the exchange. However, the requirement will not go into effect until regulations are issued.
						/ Applies to small groups only
						/ %p
						/ 	%strong> Actuarial Value (AV):
						/ 	The act designates creates four tiers of health plans available for purchase through the Exchanges. Each tier is defined by its actuarial value, or percent paid by a health plan of the percentage of the total allowed costs of benefits.They include the following levels:
						/ %ul
						/ 	%li Bronze health plan is a health plan that has an AV of 60 percent
						/ 	%li Silver health plan has an AV of 70 percent
						/ 	%li Gold health plan has an AV of 80 percent
						/ 	%li Platinum health plan has as an AV of 90 percent. The value may vary by plus or minus 2 percent.

								%strong What Should You Do:
								Prepare for the notification requirements by monitoring this document for updates.

						%p.blue.guaranteed-issue No one can be denied coverage (guaranteed issue).

						.box
							%p
								%strong STARTING DATE: 2014
							%p
								%strong What’s Ahead:
								This provision takes effect in plan years starting after January 1, 2014.
						%p.blue In most cases, employers are now required to provide a health plan to their employees (play or pay).
						%p The biggest change for large employers is the new requirement, or mandate, that employers with 50 or more FTEs offer health benefits to their full-time workers. In the law itself, this provision is referred to as employer shared responsibility. You might hear this provision referred to as “play or pay,” meaning that employers that choose not to participate will have to pay a fine.
						%p Basically, businesses with more than 50 full-time equivalents employees (FTEs) will have to provide affordable qualified health insurance coverage to their full-time employees and their dependents. Businesses that do not offer plans will pay a penalty if ever one full-time employee receives a Federal exchange subsidy.
						%p To get you started, Blue KC is sharing the following information to help you determine your company's size. For the most accurate information, consult your legal or tax advisor.

								%strong HOW TO DETERMINE YOUR COMPANY’S SIZE
						%p
							%strong If you provide coverage, what’s required?
						%p
							%strong Minimum Value:
							Employers meet min value if the plan offered pays at least 60 percent of an employee’s healthcare expenses.That means coverage must have an actuarial value of at least 60 percent, with the employee paying at most 40 percent through deductibles and copayments.
						%p
							%strong Affordable Coverage:
							Coverage must also offer affordable coverage as defined by of the Affordable Care Act. That means a worker does not have to pay more than 9.5 percent of his or her household income for the insurance.
